**Face Detection and Recognition**
This project is designed for Face Detection and Recognition using Python and OpenCV. It allows you to upload an image or a video, detect faces in it, and perform face recognition if there are multiple faces detected.

**Usage**
Upload an image or video file when prompted.
The program will display the input with rectangles around detected faces and labeled with "face_X" where X is the face number.
Face Recognition
If multiple faces are detected in the image, the project also includes face recognition capabilities using the DeepFace library. It compares the similarities between the detected faces.
Ensure that there are multiple faces detected in the image.
The program will display the detected faces with labels and calculate the similarity score between each pair of faces.
